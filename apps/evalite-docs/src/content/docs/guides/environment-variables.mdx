To call your LLM from a third-party service, you'll likely need some environment variables to keep your API keys safe.

Since **Evalite is based on Vitest**, it should already pick them up from your `vite.config.ts`.

## Setting Up Env Variables

If you don't have Vitest set up, here's how to do it:

<Steps>

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

   ```
   // .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

2. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`, if it's not already there

   ```
   // .gitignore
   .env
   ```

3. Install `dotenv`:

   ```bash
   pnpm add -D dotenv
   ```

4. Add a `vite.config.ts` file:

   ```ts
   // vite.config.ts

   import { defineConfig } from "vite";

   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       setupFiles: ["dotenv/config"],
     },
   });
   ```

</Steps>

Now, your environment variables will be available in your evals.

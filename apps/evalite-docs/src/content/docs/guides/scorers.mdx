Scorers are used to score the output of your LLM call.

[Autoevals](https://github.com/braintrustdata/autoevals) is a great library of scorers to get you started.

You can create your own using `createScorer`:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<string>({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: ({ output }) => {
    return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
  },
});

evalite("My Eval", {
  data: async () => {
    return [{ input: "Hello" }];
  },
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  scorers: [containsParis],
});
```

The `name` and `description` of the scorer will be displayed in the Evalite UI.

### Score Properties

The `score` function receives three properties on the object passed:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: ({ input, output, expected }) => {
    // input comes from `data`
    // expected also comes from `data`
    // output is the output of `task`
    return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
  },
});
```

## Type Arguments

In TypeScript, `createScorer` takes two type arguments, the input and output type:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<
  string, // Input type
  string // Output type
>({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: (output) => {
    // output is typed as string!
    return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
  },
});
```

## Scorer Metadata

You can provide metadata along with your custom scorer:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<string>({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: (output) => {
    return {
      score: output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0,
      metadata: {
        // Can be anything!
      },
    };
  },
});
```

This will be visible along with the score in the Evalite UI.

This is especially useful for debugging LLM-as-a-judge evals. In autoevals `Factuality` scorer, the metadata will include a rationale for why the scorer gave the score it did.

## Creating LLM-As-A-Judge Scorers

Here is a brief guide on building your own LLM-as-a-judge scorer.

We're looking to improve this feature with a first-class guide in the future.

```ts
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { generateObject } from "ai";
import { createScorer } from "evalite";
import { z } from "zod";

/**
 * Factuality scorer using OpenAI's GPT-4o model.
 */
export const Factuality = createScorer<string, string>({
  name: "Factuality",
  scorer: async ({ input, expected, output }) => {
    return checkFactuality({
      question: input,
      groundTruth: expected!,
      submission: output,
    });
  },
});

/**
 * Checks the factuality of a submission, using
 * OpenAI's GPT-4o model.
 */
const checkFactuality = async (opts: {
  question: string;
  groundTruth: string;
  submission: string;
}) => {
  const { object } = await generateObject({
    model: openai("gpt-4o-2024-11-20"),
    /**
     * Prompt taken from autoevals:
     *
     * {@link https://github.com/braintrustdata/autoevals/blob/5aa20a0a9eb8fc9e07e9e5722ebf71c68d082f32/templates/factuality.yaml}
     */
    prompt: `
      You are comparing a submitted answer to an expert answer on a given question. Here is the data:
      [BEGIN DATA]
      ************
      [Question]: ${opts.question}
      ************
      [Expert]: ${opts.groundTruth}
      ************
      [Submission]: ${opts.submission}
      ************
      [END DATA]

      Compare the factual content of the submitted answer with the expert answer. Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.
      The submitted answer may either be a subset or superset of the expert answer, or it may conflict with it. Determine which case applies. Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:
      (A) The submitted answer is a subset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.
      (B) The submitted answer is a superset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.
      (C) The submitted answer contains all the same details as the expert answer.
      (D) There is a disagreement between the submitted answer and the expert answer.
      (E) The answers differ, but these differences don't matter from the perspective of factuality.
    `,
    schema: z.object({
      answer: z.enum(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]).describe("Your selection."),
      rationale: z
        .string()
        .describe("Why you chose this answer. Be very detailed."),
    }),
  });

  /**
   * LLM's are well documented at being poor at generating
   */
  const scores = {
    A: 0.4,
    B: 0.6,
    C: 1,
    D: 0,
    E: 1,
  };

  return {
    score: scores[object.answer],
    metadata: {
      rationale: object.rationale,
    },
  };
};

/**
 * Use the Factuality eval like so:
 *
 * 1. The input (in data()) is a question.
 * 2. The expected output is the ground truth answer to the question.
 * 3. The output is the text to be evaluated.
 */
evalite("Factuality", {
  data: async () => {
    return [
      {
        // The question
        input: "What is the capital of France?",

        // The expected answer
        expected: "Paris",
      },
    ];
  },
  task: async (input) => {
    // Technically correct, but a nightmare for non-LLM
    // scorers to evaluate.
    return (
      "The capital of France is a city that starts " +
      "with a letter P, and ends in 'aris'."
    );
  },
  scorers: [Factuality],
});
```

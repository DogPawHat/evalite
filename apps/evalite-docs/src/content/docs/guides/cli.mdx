## Watch Mode

You can run Evalite in watch mode by running `evalite watch`:

```bash
evalite watch
```

This will watch for changes to your `.eval.ts` files and re-run the evals when they change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> I strongly recommend implementing a caching layer in your LLM calls when using watch mode. This will keep your evals running fast and avoid burning through your API credits.

## Running Specific Files

You can run specific files by passing them as arguments:

```bash
evalite my-eval.eval.ts
```

This also works for `watch` mode:

```bash
evalite watch my-eval.eval.ts
```

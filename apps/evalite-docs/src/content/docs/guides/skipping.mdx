title: Skipping Evals
---

Evalite has an `experimental_skip` modifier that you can use to skip a test.

```ts
evalite.experimental_skip("My Eval", {
  data: () => [],
  task: () => {},
});
```

This will skip the test and not run it.

This is currently in an experimental state, since it doesn't yet display in the Evalite UI.

# Evalite

It feels crazy to me that there's no TypeScript-native, local-first tool for testing LLM-powered apps.

I want a simple test runner that can:

-Run my evals on a watch script
-Show me a UI for viewing traces, scores, inputs and outputs
-Not need me to sign up for an API key

So, I'm building one.

It's based on Vitest, and it's called Evalite.

Here's an [early preview](https://www.aihero.dev/evalite-an-early-preview).
